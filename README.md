# ArcadeChessGame

First version of an arcade style chess game. Their are some bugs in the game, that will be corrected soon. 

Further developments:
Eventually a Monte Carlo Tree Search chess bot will be programmed from scratch.
The game will also host a server where people can play against eachother online.

How to run the game:
Download all the files, and install pygame (pip3). Run the main.py file.
